The OSI model is responsible for segmenting the different parts of data transfer. Each layer of the OSI model only talks 1 up and 1 down. For example the Physical layer of the OSI model canâ€™t talk to the Session or Application layer because the medium of communication is too far removed.

Wireshark is a network packet capture tool. It is the most popular packet capturing tool in the world. It gives you a nice visual of all the information it captures as far as ip addresses and http, information is concerned. It only captures packets between the host and the remote network connection, it can not be used to directly view others traffic.
