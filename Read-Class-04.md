What is group policy and what role does it play in data security?

Group policy manager is a piece of software included with windows server manager that allows you to enforce, automate, and control many many tasks in the windows OS. More specifically, you can control many remote computers with Windows server manager. These PCs can be made very secure to work in, for example say you have an employee that finds a flash drive outside of work. Unbeknownst to the employee it's full of malware. So they plug it into their work PC and BOOOM!! Popup after pop up and their lock out. Well GPO can prevent this fiasco by turning off all USB ports. Problem solved, you are not fired, the company doesn't lose millions, and everybody is happy, except maybe the guy (or gal) that created the malware.
