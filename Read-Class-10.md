What is site to site vpn?

Site to site vpn is the most direct kind of vpn in which both sites know the destination of the traffic. Site to site is often used when information needs to be incripte over a large geographical distance, but the necessary hardware infrastructure for a more robust vpn hasnâ€™t been set up. In the case of site to site the users piggy back of the internet to avoid high overhead cost, and establish a viable vpn connection. Other kinds of vpn include client to site, split tunnel, and full tunnel. Every one of them has drawbacks and advantages. 
RDP or remote desktop protocol is a method by which a user can remotely access information stored in a geographically distant server. This is very useful when work needs to be done from a remote connection, or when last minute changes are made after work hours, without needing direct access to the physical office location.
