What is a windows domain and how does it affect my network?
A windows domain is essentially a controller of an organized group. 
It allows IT professionals to manage and maintain a large volume of computers. 
It also restricts many administrative privileges thereby limiting what users can do on work or school computers. 
If a domain is established in a network all of the functionality just stated can be incorporated.
