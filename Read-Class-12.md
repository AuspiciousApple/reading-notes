Authentication Methods

RADIUS is a type of authentication method that uses a remote authentication server to verify you are who you say you are. When a user wants to access information on a remote server, the local user will send their authentication information to the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server replies with  a successful authentication as well as an authorization of the required resources. 
This is known as AAA or authenticate, authorize and account. Authenticate as the aforementioned process just verifies the user's identity. Authorization as mentioned above gives access or permissions necessary to the user to do what the user wishes. Account is the final step which keeps a log of the date, time, and other identifiable information for future reference.
