As it relates to networking, it is important to be able to distinguish between the admin from the regular users. 
The users have restricted permissions whereas the admin has full control over the domain. 
Windows 2019 would be considered an admin in this case, they would be responsible for group policies, adding and removing users from a created domain, and many  more responsibilities. Windows 10 is a very typical OS, that includes all the functionality of a home computer, it just lacks the ability to manage other computers on a large scale. 
“Windows Server is locked down” & “Windows Server is more expensive”
As stated the actual OS of the Windows Server is very compartmentalized, it is done so intentionally to reduce the likelihood of compromise. Basic functions and features like access to the internet, and proprietary Microsoft software are restricted to avoid unsecure connections to third party software.
	With all these features and restrictions comes more cost, as it is “intended for business” its price can vary from “$500-6200.”
