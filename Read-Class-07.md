	Nginx is a piece of software that allows you a variety of functions. These include a load balancer, web server, and reverse proxy. As a reverse proxy it allows websites with huge amounts of traffic to properly guide network traffic. As a load balancer it allows websites such as Netflix to distribute the flow of network traffic evenly. Moreover, it is also commonly used to reduce the total network load on a given website by “negotiating SSL/TLS or compressing and caching content.” Nginx is not only useful in reducing the overall network load, but also in increasing the overall security of web servers because connections are not sent directly to the website host.
