Virtual box network types

Virutal box offers various network types for different situations. Weather you want to bridge your home WAN or design your own router using pf sense virtual box has got you covered. The NAT network allows the user to create a new network independent of the host computer. The NAT network does the same things as a normal NAT profile expect it creates a LAN of more than one NAT connected via a switch. The bridge adapter allows the virtual machine to directly connect to your very own router, bridging the connection between the vm and your pc. The host only profile allows the user to create and manage a router outside of the virtual space, and local area network.
