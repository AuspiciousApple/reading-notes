Active directory is a centralized management service, meant for system administrators. It is supported by the Microsoft server OS. 
It can be used to do many things including, but not limited to setting up a DNS server, configuring users writing a domain, configuring groups of users to streamline the process of integrating new employees on board.
Not only is it feature rich but as explained by CyberArk: “ Active Directory helps businesses improve security by controlling access to network resources.” Restricting access to network functions allows for an isolated environment, if your guests are isolated from most outside connections it only makes sense that the likelihood of compromising their passwords or infecting a machine with malware is reduced.
